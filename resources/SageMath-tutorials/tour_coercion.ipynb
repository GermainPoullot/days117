    "\n",
    "If one wants to implement a ring in Python, a first approximation is to\n",
    "create a class for the elements `X` of that ring and provide it with the\n",
    "required double underscore methods such as `__add__`, `__sub__`,\n",

    "\n",
    "As Python is a strongly typed (yet dynamically typed) language, one\n",

    "for each ring. After all, Python contains one type `<int>` for the\n",
    "integers, one type `<float>` for the reals, and so on. But that approach\n",
    "must soon fail: There are infinitely many rings, and one can not\n",
    "implement infinitely many classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, one may create a hierarchy of classes designed to implement\n",
    "elements of ubiquitous algebraic structures, such as groups, rings, skew\n",

    "1.  A coercion from `P1` to `P2` must be given by a structure preserving\n",
    "    map (e.g., a ring homomorphism). It does not suffice that *some*\n",
    "    elements of `P1` can be mapped to `P2`, and the map must respect the\n",
    "    algebraic structure of `P1`.\n",
    "2.  The choice of these coercion maps must be consistent: If `P3` is a\n",
    "    third parent structure, then the composition of the chosen coercion\n",
    "    from `P1` to `P2` with the coercion from `P2` to `P3` must coincide\n",
