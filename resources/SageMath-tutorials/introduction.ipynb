    "1.  The Sage download file comes with \"batteries included\". In other\n",

    "    Maxima, NTL, GMP, and so on, you do not need to install them\n",
    "    separately as they are included with the Sage distribution. However,\n",
    "    to use certain Sage features, e.g., Macaulay or KASH, you must have\n",
    "    the relevant programs installed on your computer already.\n",

    "2.  The pre-compiled binary version of Sage (found on the Sage web site)\n",
    "    may be easier and quicker to install than the source code version.\n",

    "3.  If you'd like to use the SageTeX package (which allows you to embed\n",

    "## Ways to Use Sage\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Sage in several ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Notebook graphical interface:** run `sage -n jupyter`; see [the\n",
    "    Jupyter documentation\n",
    "    on-line](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html),\n",
    "-   **Interactive command line:** see\n",
    "    [chapter-interactive\\_shell](chapter-interactive_shell.ipynb),\n",
    "-   **Programs:** By writing interpreted and compiled programs in Sage\n",
    "    (see [section-loadattach](section-loadattach.ipynb) and\n",
    "    [section-compile](section-compile.ipynb)), and\n",
    "-   **Scripts:** by writing stand-alone Python scripts that use the Sage\n",
    "    library (see [section-standalone](section-standalone.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Longterm Goals for Sage\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Useful**: Sage's intended audience is mathematics students (from\n",
    "    high school to graduate school), teachers, and research\n",
    "    mathematicians. The aim is to provide software that can be used to\n",
    "    explore and experiment with mathematical constructions in algebra,\n",
    "    geometry, number theory, calculus, numerical computation, etc. Sage\n",
    "    helps make it easier to interactively experiment with mathematical\n",
    "    objects.\n",
    "-   **Efficient:** Be fast. Sage uses highly-optimized mature software\n",
    "    like GMP, PARI, GAP, and NTL, and so is very fast at certain\n",
    "    operations.\n",
    "-   **Free and open source:** The source code must be freely available\n",
    "    and readable, so users can understand what the system is really\n",
    "    doing and more easily extend it. Just as mathematicians gain a\n",
    "    deeper understanding of a theorem by carefully reading or at least\n",
    "    skimming the proof, people who do computations should be able to\n",
    "    understand how the calculations work by reading documented source\n",
    "    code. If you use Sage to do computations in a paper you publish, you\n",
    "    can rest assured that your readers will always have free access to\n",
    "    Sage and all its source code, and you are even allowed to archive\n",
    "    and re-distribute the version of Sage you used.\n",
    "-   **Easy to compile:** Sage should be easy to compile from source for\n",
    "    Linux, OS X and Windows users. This provides more flexibility for\n",
    "    users to modify the system.\n",
    "-   **Cooperation:** Provide robust interfaces to most other computer\n",
    "    algebra systems, including PARI, GAP, Singular, Maxima, KASH, Magma,\n",
    "    Maple, and Mathematica. Sage is meant to unify and extend existing\n",
    "    math software.\n",
    "-   **Well documented:** Tutorial, programming guide, reference manual,\n",
    "    and how-to, with numerous examples and discussion of background\n",
    "    mathematics.\n",
    "-   **Extensible:** Be able to define new data types or derive from\n",
    "    built-in types, and use code written in a range of languages.\n",
    "-   **User friendly**: It should be easy to understand what\n",
    "    functionality is provided for a given object and to view\n",
    "    documentation and source code. Also attain a high level of user\n",
    "    support."
