    "# Linear Programming (Mixed Integer)\n",
    "\n",
    "This document explains the use of linear programming (LP) -- and of\n",
    "mixed integer linear programming (MILP) -- in Sage by illustrating it\n",
    "with several problems it can solve. Most of the examples given are\n",
    "motivated by graph-theoretic concerns, and should be understandable\n",
    "without any specific knowledge of this field. As a tool in\n",
    "Combinatorics, using linear programming amounts to understanding how to\n",
    "reformulate an optimization (or existence) problem through linear\n",
    "constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a translation of a chapter from the book [Calcul mathematique\n",
    "avec Sage](https://www.sagemath.org/sagebook/french.html). This book now\n",
    "exists in [English,\n",
    "too](https://www.sagemath.org/sagebook/english.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we present the usual definition of what a linear program is: it is\n",
    "defined by a matrix $A: \\mathbb{R}^m \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^n$, along with\n",
    "two vectors $b,c \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. Solving a linear program is\n",
    "searching for a vector $x$ maximizing an *objective* function and\n",
    "satisfying a set of constraints, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c^t x = \\max_{x' \\text{ such that } Ax' \\leq b} c^t x'$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the ordering $u \\leq u'$ between two vectors means that the\n",
    "entries of $u'$ are pairwise greater than the entries of $u$. We also\n",
    "write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\text{Max: } & c^t x\\\\\n",
    "\\text{Such that: } & Ax \\leq b\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalently, we can also say that solving a linear program amounts to\n",
    "maximizing a linear function defined over a polytope (preimage or\n",
    "$A^{-1} (\\leq b)$). These definitions, however, do not tell us how to\n",
    "use linear programming in combinatorics. In the following, we will show\n",
    "how to solve optimization problems like the Knapsack problem, the\n",
    "Maximum Matching problem, and a Flow problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mixed integer linear programming\n",
    "\n",
    "There are bad news coming along with this definition of linear\n",
    "programming: an LP can be solved in polynomial time. This is indeed bad\n",
    "news, because this would mean that unless we define LP of exponential\n",
    "size, we cannot expect LP to solve NP-complete problems, which would be\n",
    "a disappointment. On a brighter side, it becomes NP-complete to solve a\n",
    "linear program if we are allowed to specify constraints of a different\n",
    "kind: requiring that some variables be integers instead of real values.\n",
    "Such an LP is actually called a \"mixed integer linear program\" (some\n",
    "variables can be integers, some other reals). Hence, we can expect to\n",
    "find in the MILP framework a *wide* range of expressivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `MILP` class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MILP` class in Sage represents a MILP! It is also used to solve\n",
    "regular LP. It has a very small number of methods, meant to define our\n",
    "set of constraints and variables, then to read the solution found by the\n",
    "solvers once computed. It is also possible to export a MILP defined with\n",
    "Sage to a `.lp` or `.mps` file, understood by most solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us ask Sage to solve the following LP:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\text{Max: } & x + y + 3z\\\\\n",
    "\\text{Such that: } & x + 2y \\leq 4\\\\\n",
    "\\text{} & 5z - y \\leq 8\\\\\n",
    "\\text{} & x,y,z \\geq 0\\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve it, we need to define a corresponding `MILP` object, along\n",
    "with 3 variables `x`, `y` and `z` :"
